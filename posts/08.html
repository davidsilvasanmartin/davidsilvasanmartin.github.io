\textbf{Abstract.} The aim of this writing is to show that sections $a)$ and $b)$ of the solution of Exercise 3.14 in Introduction to Probability Models\cite{ross} use different assumptions and are thus incompatible (that is: both solutions can not be right at the same time).\\

\textbf{Exercise 2.30.} At a party $N$ men throw their hats into the center of the room. Each man then randomly selects one. Find the expected number of men who select their own hats.\\

\textit{Commentary on the book's solution:}\\

Let $X$ be the number of men that select their own hats. There are 2 ways the hat selection can be carried out. Let's describe them first.\\

\begin{enumerate}
 \item \underline{With replacement}. Each of the men selects a hat, but they don't keep it: hats are thrown back immediately into the center of the room. Man 1 has $N$ hats to choose from. So do each of the other men. For the particular case $N=2$, all possible options are shown on the following table:
     \begin{table}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
            \hline
            Event & $A_1$ & $A_2$ & $A_3$ & $A_4$\\\hline
            \makecell{Selected \\ hats} & \makecell{$M1-H1$\\$M2-H1$} & \makecell{$M1-H1$\\$M2-H2$} & \makecell{$M1-H2$\\$M2-H1$} & \makecell{$M1-H2$\\$M2-H2$} \\\hline
            $P(A_j)$ & $1/4$ & $1/4$ & $1/4$ & $1/4$  \\\hline
            $X$ & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1  \\\hline
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{Hat selection cases, $N=2$. With replacement.}
        \label{Values}
    \end{table}
Where $Mi-Hj$ means that man $i$ selects the hat $j$, which belongs to $Mj$.\\
 \item \underline{Without replacement}. Man 1 selects a hat, and then he keeps it until the round is over. Man 2 will have $N-1$ hats to choose from, man 3 will have $N-2$, and so on. For the particular case $N=2$, the options are:
     \begin{table}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
            \hline
            & $A_1$ & $A_2$ \\\hline
            \makecell{Selected \\ hats} & \makecell{$M1-H1$\\$M2-H2$} & \makecell{$M1-H2$\\$M2-H1$} \\\hline
            $P(A_j)$ & $1/2$ & $1/2$ \\\hline
            $X$ & 2 & 0  \\\hline
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{Hat selection cases, $N=2$. Without replacement.}
        \label{Values}
    \end{table}
The result that
$$P\{ i \text{th man selects his own hat} \} = 1/N, \text{ for all } i \text{ and } N,$$
holds for either of the 2 cases. This is easily seen by counting the cases in which man 1 selects hat 1 and adding up probabilities, and doing the same for man 2. We won't provide a formal proof here.\\
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Exercise 3.14. [The matching rounds problem]} Suppose in Exercise 2.30 that those choosing their own hats depart, while the others (those without a match) leave all other hats in the center of the room, mix them up, and then re-select. Also, suppose that this process continues until each individual has his own hat.
\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] Find $E[R_n]$, where $R_n$ is the number of rounds that are necessary when $n$ individuals are initially present.
\item[b)] Find $E[S_n]$, where $S_n$ is the number of selections made by $n$ individuals, $n \geq 2$.
\end{itemize}\ \\

\textit{Commentary on the book's solution:}\\

We will now try to prove that the solutions to sections $a)$ and $b)$ provided in the book are incompatible.\\

\textbf{Lemma 1.} The book's solution of part $a)$ requires that there is replacement.\\
