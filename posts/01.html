    Very often we need to be able to differentiate between Typescript interfaces
    which have some properties in common. This is known as "type narrowing". We
    are going to cover 3 basic ways of performing type narrowing in Typescript.
</p>

<p>Let's start with the following example:</p>

<pre class="typescript">
interface Vehicle {
    weight: number;
    wheels?: number;
    class?: 'A' | '1' | '2' |'3';
}</pre
>

<p>
    In our application we have different vehicles. For trucks, for example, we
    want to keep track of their weight, and their number of wheels. However, other
    vehicles (like a yacht) have no wheels, but have other attributes we want to
    know, like for instance their class, which is a string that can take values
    'A', '1', '2', or '3'. We might think that a good configuration can be as
    follows:
</p>

<pre class="typescript">
interface Truck {
    weight: number;
    wheels: number;
}

interface Yacht {
    weight: number;
    class: 'A' | '1' | '2' | '3';
}

export type Vehicle = Truck | Yacht;
</pre>

<p>
    However, with this setup we will have a problem when trying to use `Vehicle`
    objects:
</p>

        class="wp-image-86"
        src="https://cybertricks.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/screenshot-from-2021-07-04-10-50-48-1.png"
/>

<img
        alt="IDE error property does not exist"
        class="wp-image-85"
        src="https://cybertricks.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/screenshot-from-2021-07-04-10-50-52-2.png"
/>

<p>
    As we can see, Typescript can't decide whether the input object is a
    <code>Truck</code> or a <code>Yacht</code>, and it throws the following error:
    <code>Property 'wheels' does not exist on type 'Yacht'</code>
    . How can we narrow the object's type? There are at least 3 alternatives:
</p>

<h2>Create a new "type" property on each of the interfaces</h2>

<pre class="typescript">
interface Truck {
    weight: number;
    wheels: number;
    type: 'truck';
}

interface Yacht {
    weight: number;
    class: 'A' | '1' | '2' | '3';
    type: 'yacht';
}

export type Vehicle = Truck | Yacht;
</pre>

<p>
    This is known as
    <a
            href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#discriminated-unions"
    >discriminated unions</a
    >
    in Typescript. This solution would be the most adequate if our interfaces
    already had the <code>type</code> attribute beforehand.
</p>

<p>
    When using <code>Vehicle</code> objects, now we can use a switch case to
    differentiate both interfaces:
</p>

<img
        alt="Use vehicle in switch statement"
        class="wp-image-84"
        src="https://cybertricks.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/screenshot-from-2021-07-04-11-09-22.png"
/>

<p>
    If we are using classes instead of interfaces for our types, the following
    alternative syntax produces the exact same result:
</p>

<pre class="typescript">
class Truck {
  weight: number;
  wheels: number;
  readonly type = 'truck';
}

class Yacht {
  weight: number;
  class: 'A' | '1' | '2' | '3';
  readonly type = 'yacht';
}

export type Vehicle = Truck | Yacht;</pre
>

<h2>Use type guards</h2>

<p>
    <a
            href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates"
    >Type guards</a
    >
    are functions that help with type narrowing.
</p>

<pre class="typescript">
interface Truck {
  weight: number;
  wheels: number;
}

interface Yacht {
  weight: number;
  class: 'A' | '1' | '2' | '3';
}

export type Vehicle = Truck | Yacht;

export function isTruck(arg: any): arg is Truck {
  return !!arg.weight &amp;&amp; !!arg.wheels;
}

export function isYacht(arg: any): arg is Yacht {
  return !!arg.weight &amp;&amp; !!arg.class;
}</pre
>

<p>
    If <code>isTruck(object)</code> returns <code>true</code>, it means that our
    object is indeed a <code>Truck</code>. We can import and use these functions
    anywhere in our application:
</p>

<img
        alt="Use type guards"
        class="wp-image-83"
        src="https://cybertricks.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/screenshot-from-2021-07-04-12-04-09.png"
/>

<p>
    However, there is a small problem with this setup: we can still build
    <code>Vehicle</code> objects which are not <code>Truck</code> nor
    <code>Yacht</code>:
</p>

<img
        alt="Vehicle defined with wheels and class"
        class="wp-image-82"
        src="https://cybertricks.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/screenshot-from-2021-07-04-12-17-11.png"
/>

<h2>Use “never”</h2>

<p>
    In order to fix this last problem we can use
    <a
            href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-0.html#the-never-type"
    >the <code>never</code> type, introduced in Typescript 2.0</a
    >. If an interface has a property of type <code>never</code>, then that
    property can not be defined on any object which follows that interface.
</p>

<pre class="typescript">
interface Truck {
  weight: number;
  wheels: number;
  class?: never;
}

interface Yacht {
  weight: number;
  wheels?: never;
  class: 'A' | '1' | '2' | '3';
}

export type Vehicle = Truck | Yacht;</pre
>

<p>
    Type guards work exactly as they previously did, but now we can't create
    <code>Vehicle</code> objects which have at the same time both the
    <code>wheels</code> and <code>class</code> properties:
</p>

<img
        alt="Error when defining Vehicle with wheels and class"
        class="wp-image-81"
        src="https://cybertricks.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/screenshot-from-2021-07-04-12-21-04.png"
/>

<img
        alt="Error type not assignable to Vehicle"
        class="wp-image-80"
        src="https://cybertricks.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/screenshot-from-2021-07-04-12-21-07.png"
/>

<p>As we can see we obtain the following error:</p>

<pre class="text">
Type '{ weight: number; wheels: number; class: "A" }' is not assignable to type 'Vehicle'.
Types of property 'wheels' are incompatible.
Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'never'.</pre
>
