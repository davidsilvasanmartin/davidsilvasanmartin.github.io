<h2>Git (GitHub): Squash & Merge vs Merge Commit</h2>
<p>
    My experience: when having the following scenario
</p>
<pre>
             PR #1          PR #2
    BranchA &lt;----- BranchB &lt;----- BranchC 
</pre>
<p>
    Then we have to merge PR #1 using "Merge pull request" instead of "Squash and merge".
    Otherwise git will not be able to change the target of PR #2 properly and there will likely be
    merge conflicts that we'll need to resolve.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, "Squash and merge" keeps the commit history clean. All commits in one particular branch
    are squashed into one commit before being merged into the target branch. I prefer using "Squash and merge"
    for changes that go into the main branch. This way, when checking the history of a file, I can easily
    identify the commit in which the change was introduced. This commit identifies the PR. Knowing the PR,
    I can easily find the context of the change by looking for related Jira tickets or documentation.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, my preference is as follows: use "Merge pull request" for chained PRs and PRs that are targeted
    to a feature branch. Use "Squash and merge" for PRs that are targeted to the main branch.
