<p>Let \(\Omega\) be a set.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Def 1.</strong> A <strong>\(\sigma\)-field</strong> is a collection
    \(\mathcal{F}\) of subsets of \(\Omega\) such that \(\emptyset \in
    \mathcal{F}\), and it's closed under complementation and under countable
    unions.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Def 2.</strong> The sets that are members of \(\mathcal{F}\) are said
    to be <strong>measurable with respect to \(\mathcal{F}\)</strong>, or just
    <strong>measurable</strong> if the \(\sigma\)-field is understood from the
    context.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Def 3.</strong> A <strong>probability measure</strong> \(P\) on a \(\sigma\)-field
    \(\mathcal{F}\) of subsets of \(\Omega\) is a function:

    \begin{align}
    P: \ &\mathcal{F}\longrightarrow \left[0, 1\right] \\
    &A \mapsto P(A)
    \end{align}
    such that:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>\( P(\Omega) = 1 \).</li>
    <li>
        For each pairwise disjoint sequence of elements of \(\mathcal{F}, A_m, m \in \mathbb{N}:\)
        \(P(\cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty P(A_i)\).
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    For each \(A \in \mathcal{F}\), \(P(A)\) is called the <strong>probability of \(A\).</strong>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Def 4.</strong> A <strong>probability space</strong> is a triple \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)\)
    where
</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(\Omega\) is a set.</li>
    <li>\(\mathcal{F}\) is a \(\sigma\)-field of subsets of \(\Omega\).</li>
    <li>\(P\) is a probability measure on \(\mathcal{F}\).</li>
</ul>
<p>
    \(\Omega\) is called the <strong>sample space</strong> and its members are called
    <strong>sample points</strong>. The members of \(\mathcal{F}\) are called <strong>events</strong>.
    We sometimes say that \(P\) is a probability measure on \(\Omega\) or on
    \((\Omega, \mathcal{F})\) rather than on \(\mathcal{F}\).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Notation.</strong> We will often not distinguish between the sample point
    \(\omega\) and the event \(\{\omega\}\).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Def 5.</strong> If \(\Omega\) is a topological space, the <strong>Borel \(\sigma\)-field</strong>
    of \(\Omega\) is the one generated by the collection of all open sets. The members
    of the Borel \(\sigma\)-field are called <strong>Borel sets</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Notation.</strong> We will denote the Borel \(\sigma\)-field of \(\mathbb{R}\)
    by \(\mathbb{B}\).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Def 6.</strong> A <strong>measurable space</strong> is a pair \((\Psi, \mathcal{G})\) where
    \(\Psi\) is a nonempty set and \(\mathcal{G}\) is a \(\sigma\)-field of subsets of \(\Psi\).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Remark.</strong> If \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)\) si a probability space, then
    \((\Omega, \mathcal{F})\) is a measurable space.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Def 7.</strong>
    Let \((\Omega, \mathcal{F})\) and \((\Psi, \mathcal{G})\) be measurable spaces.
    A <strong>measurable function</strong> from \((\Omega, \mathcal{F})\) to \((\Psi, \mathcal{G})\)
    is a function \(X: \Omega \rightarrow \Psi\) such that \(X^{-1}(B) \in \mathcal{F}\)
    for all \(B \in \mathcal{G}\).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Def 8.</strong> A <strong>random variable</strong> defined on a probability space
    \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)\) is a measurable function from \((\Omega, \mathcal{F})\) to
    \((\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{B})\). As a consequence, \(X^{-1}(B) \in \mathcal{F}\)
    for each \(B \in \mathbb{B}\).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Notation.</strong> For \(B \in \mathbb{B}\), the following
    expressions are equivalent:
</p>
\begin{align}
X^{-1}(B) &\equiv \{ \omega \in \Omega \mid X(\omega) \in B\} \equiv \{X \in B\};\\
P \{ X \in B \} &\equiv P \{\omega \in \Omega \mid X(\omega) \in B\}
\end{align}

<p>
    <strong>Prop 1.</strong> If \(X\) is a random variable on \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)\)
    and the function \(g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) is measurable respect to \(\mathbb{B}\),
    then
</p>
\begin{align}
g(X): \ &\Omega \longrightarrow &\mathbb{R} \longrightarrow &\mathbb{R} \\
&A \mapsto &X(A) \mapsto &g(X(A))
\end{align}
<p>
    is a random variable. In particular, this conclusion is true when
    \(g\) is a continuous function.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Prop 2.</strong>
