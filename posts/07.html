<div style="font-weight: bold">
    <span style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 4px;">1</span> A coin with probability p of landing on heads is
    continually flipped.
    <ul>
        <li>
            Let \(N\) be the number of flips until there have been both at least \(n\)
            heads and at least \(m\) tails. Derive an expression for \(E[N]\).
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    Note that the minimum value \(N\) can take is \(n + m\). We won't use this
    info for our calculations, though.
</p>
<p>
    Let \(H :=\) "Number of heads in the first \(n + m\) flips". \(H\) has
    clearly a binomial distribution \(B(m+n, p)\). Therefore,
</p>
\begin{align}
P\{H = h\} = {m + n \choose h} p^h (1-p)^{m+n-h}
\end{align}

<p>
    To calculate the expected value of \(N\), condition on \(H\):
</p>
\begin{align}
E[N] &= \sum_{h=0}^{n+m} E\left[N \mid H=h\right] P\{H=h\} = \\
&= \sum_{h=0}^{n-1} P\{H=h\} E\left[N \mid H=h\right] +
P\{H = n\} E\left[N \mid H=n\right] +  \\
&\qquad + \sum_{h=n + 1}^{n + m} P\{H = h\} E\left[N \mid H=h\right]
\end{align}

    There are three different scenarios. To think about them, let's build
    a particular example. Let's set \(n = 3\) and \(m = 2\). Then, we
    are looking for \(N\)="Number of flips until we have obtained both
    at least \(n = 3\) heads and at least \(m = 2\) tails". We will
    be conditioning on \(h\) = "Number of heads obtained in the first
    \(5\) flips". The three scenarios are:
</p>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            \(h \in \{0, \ldots, n - 1\}\)
            <ul>
                <li>
                    For example, let's think of the particular case \(h = 2\).
                    We have obtained 2 heads and 3 tails in our first 5 flips.
                    Valid sequences of flips are: (⭘, ⭘, ×, ×, ×),
                    (⭘, ×, ⭘, ×, ×), (⭘, ×, ×, ⭘, ×), and so on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each of these sequences has more than \(m = 2\) tails.
                    From this point on, what do we need to finish the game?
                    We need to obtain \(n-h\) more heads.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let \(Z_1\)="Number of flips until we obtain \(n-h\) heads
                    for the first time". Clearly, \(Z_1\) follows a negative
                    binomial distribution: \(Z_1 \sim NB(n-h, p) \), having
                    \(E[Z_1]=(n-h)/p\).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Conditioned by \(H=h\), the distribution of the random
                    variable \((N - m - n)\) is the same as the distribution
                    of \(Z_1\) (without conditioning). The reason why we need
                    to subtract "\(-m-n\)" from \(N\) to compare it to \(Z_1\)
                    may not be obvious. <span style="font-weight: bold;color: red;">TODO : EXPLAIN !!!!</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Therefore, \(E[N - n - m \mid H=h] = E[Z_1] = (n-h)/p\), which
                    gives that \(E[N \mid H=h] = n + m + (n-h)/p\) for all
                    \(h\) from \(0\) to \(n-1\).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            \(h = n\)
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If there are \(n\) heads in the first \(n + m\) flips, there must
                    also be \(m\) tails. The game is then finished at this point.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Therefore, \(E[N \mid H = n]= n + m\).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            \(h \in \{n + 1, \ldots, n + m\}\)
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Let's think about the particular case \(h = 4\).
                    We have obtained 4 heads and 1 tail in our first 5 flips.
                    Valid sequences of flips are: (⭘, ⭘, ⭘, ⭘, ×),
                    (⭘, ⭘, ⭘, ×, ⭘), (⭘, ⭘, ×, ⭘, ⭘), and so on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each of these sequences has more than \(n=3\) heads. And
                    it has \(n + m - h\) tails. From this point on, we need to
                    obtain \(m - (n + m -h) = h - n\) more tails in order to
                    finish the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let \(Z_2\)="Number of flips until we obtain \(h-n\) tails
                    for the first time". Clearly, \(Z_2\) follows a negative
                    binomial distribution: \(Z_2 \sim NB(h-n, 1-p) \), having
                    \(E[Z_1]=(h-n)/(1-p)\). Note that the "probability of success"
                    of \(Z_2\)'s Bernoulli trials is this time \(1-p\).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Conditioned by \(H=h\), the distribution of \(N\) is the
                    same as the distribution of \(Z_2\) (without conditioning).
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;color: red;">TODO : Change (wrong) !!!!</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Therefore, \(E[N \mid H=h] = E[Z_2] = (h-n)/(1-p)\), for all
                    \(h\) from \(n + 1\) to \(n + m\).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    Putting all this together, we obtain:
</p>

\begin{align}
E[N] &= \sum_{h = 0}^{n -1} \left( n + m + \frac{n-h}{p} \right)
P \{H = h\} + \\
&\qquad + (n + m) P \{H = n\}+ \\
&\qquad + \sum_{h = n + 1}^{n + m} \left( n + m + \frac{h-n}{1-p} \right)
P \{H = h\} \\
\end{align}

<div style="font-weight: bold">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Find the most simplified expression of the result for \(m = n\) and
            \( p = 1/2 \).
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

\begin{align}
E[N] &= \sum_{h = 0}^{n -1} \left( n + n + \frac{n-h}{1/2} \right)
P \{H = h\} + \\
&\qquad + (n + n) P \{H = n\}+ \\
&\qquad + \sum_{h = n + 1}^{n + n} \left( n + n + \frac{h-n}{1-1/2} \right)
P \{H = h\} = \\
&= \sum_{h = 0}^{n -1} \left(4n - 2h \right)
P \{H = h\} + \\
&\qquad + 2n P \{H = n\}+ \\
&\qquad + \sum_{h = n + 1}^{2n} 2h P \{H = h\} \\
\end{align}

<p>
    Maybe we can group some of those terms in a way that allows us to use
    \(E[H]\), which is known to be \(p(m + n)\).
