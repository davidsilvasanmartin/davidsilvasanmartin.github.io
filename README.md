## TODO
- Not sure if SCSS is working properly on thus project.
- Check if `@eslint/eslintrc` can be removed.
- Maybe swap rehype-highlight by rehype-prism to see if it's better.
- Read https://unifiedjs.com/learn/guide/introduction-to-unified/
- Read https://hackmd.io/@RintarouTW/unified_remark_and_rehype (change color to light)
- Have a look at `.use(remarkFrontmatter, ["yaml"]).use(remarkParseFrontmatter)`,
a `unified` plugins to replace `grey-matter`.
